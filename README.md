# RawUEFI
RawUEFI is a Rust crate providing idiomatic raw Rust bindings for the Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI). RawUEFI is to maintain a low-level API over UEFI and aims to be as
simple as possible.

Links to the corresponding portions of the UEFI Specification will be included in the
corresponding portions of the crate documentation for your reference, in case the crate
documentation is not clear enough. The UEFI Specification should be the ultimate reference as
it is the most accurate in all cases.

The module-level documentation of individual modules provide in-depth documentation about the
individual modules within RawUEFI. They explain the main purpose and specifies usage of the
module in detail. The module names should also give a rough idea of the functionality of
individual modules.
