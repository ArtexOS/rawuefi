//! # UEFI Tables
//!
//! There are many UEFI tables that store various data or contain pointers to useful functions. The
//! `tables` module provides accurate bindings and representations of each fo these tables, and
//! detailed documentation will be provided on each.
//!
//! Each UEFI table has its own header. It is a data structure that precedes any UEFI table. It
//! includes a signature that is unique for each table type, a revision of the table that may be
//! updated as extensions are added to the EFI table types, and a 32-bit CRC so a consumer of an
//! EFI table type can validate the integrity of the contents of the EFI table. See
//! [Section 4.2 of the UEFI Specification] for more details. The table header data structure is
//! defined in this crate as the [`EFI_TABLE_HEADER`] structure.
//!
//! [`EFI_TABLE_HEADER`]: crate::tables::EFI_TABLE_HEADER
//!
//! [Section 4.2 of the UEFI Specification]: https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/04_EFI_System_Table.html#efi-table-header

/// **Note 1:** The capabilities found in the EFI System Table, Runtime Services Table and Boot
/// Services Table may change over time. The first field in each of these tables is an [`EFI_TABLE_HEADER`].
/// This headerâ€™s [`Revision`] field is incremented when new capabilities and functions are added
/// to the functions in the table. When checking for capabilities, code should verify that [`Revision`]
/// is greater than or equal to the revision level of the table at the point when the capabilities
/// were added to the UEFI specification.
///
/// **Note 2:** Unless otherwise specified, UEFI uses a standard CCITT32 CRC algorithm with a seed
/// polynomial value of `0x04C11DB7` for its CRC calculations.
///
/// **Note 3:**  The size of the System Table, Runtime Services Table, and Boot Services Table may
/// increase over time. It is very important to always use the [`HeaderSize`] field of the
/// [`EFI_TABLE_HEADER`] to determine the size of these tables.
