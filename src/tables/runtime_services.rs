//! # UEFI Runtime Services
//!
//! UEFI uses the EFI Runtime Services Table, which contains a table header and pointers to all of
//! the runtime services. The definition for this table is shown in the following code fragments.
//! Except for the table header, all elements in the EFI Runtime Services Tables are prototypes of
//! function pointers to functions as defined in Services â€” Runtime Services. Unlike the EFI Boot
//! Services Table, this table, and the function pointers it contains are valid after the UEFI OS
//! loader and OS have taken control of the platform with a call to [`EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.ExitBootServices()`].
//! If a call to [`SetVirtualAddressMap()`] is made by the OS, then the function pointers in this
//! table are fixed up to point to the new virtually mapped entry points.
